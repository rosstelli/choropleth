<b> How To Use </b><br /><br />
The initial display is information of the unemployment rate according to each county.<br/><br/>
To interact with the graph, click on any county. An orange dot will appear on the county selected.
On the right hand side of the figure, the county information will display in the top rectangle.
As the mouse moves around the map, a green circle appears in the county that the mouse is currently hovered over.
The information for this county will display on the bottom right rectangle.
This creates an easy to use comparison between any two counties.
<br/><br/>
The sliders at the top act as a threshold for minimum and maximum of an unemployment rate to appear, respectively.
This means that the user can create any range of values to be observed in the map.
Counties that do not fall in this range will turn light-gray.
